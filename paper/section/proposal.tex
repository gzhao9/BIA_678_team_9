\section{1234}
The topic we would like to cover in my term paper is the use of big data for malware detection. There is so much data created every second coming across our networks and itâ€™s nearly impossible for humans alone to detect and identify all malicious activity. We need systems to help the analysts review this vast amount of data\cite{8406963} and derive actionable insights from the data. Additionally, in order for us to use the network data in a timely manner, we need to be able to process the data so distributed computing tools and technologies like Spark become indispensable. We plan to investigate how the analytics teams (often in Security Operations Centers also known as SOCs)\cite{zhou2021rethinking}collect their data, how they process the large amounts of data, how they train their models and/or algorithms to find malware, and what type of governance goes into place in order to keep data secure, private, and encrypted. \cite{8406963,no_5,poudyal2019malware,no_4,wassermann2018bigmomal}
